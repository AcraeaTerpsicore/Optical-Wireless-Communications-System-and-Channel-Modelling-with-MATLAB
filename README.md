## Overview

This repository contains the source code related to *Optical Wireless Communications System and Channel Modelling with MATLAB*. 

**Some of the original code had issues and required modifications. I have made the necessary adjustments to enhance practicality and functionality.**



## MATLAB Version

MATLAB R2024a

## Directory Structure

- `util/` - Utility scripts and functions.

## Some Code Descriptions

Below is a list of the MATLAB scripts included in this repository (not all):

| Name                     | Description                                                                                                                     |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `CORRECT_plot_Fig3p31.m` | The gamma-gamma probability density function (PDF)                                                                              |
| `CORRECT_plot_Fig3p28.m` | PDF of log-normal distribution                                                                                                  |
| `CORRECT_program_4p4.m`  | Program 4.4: MATLAB code to simulate Bit Error Rate (BER) of On-Off Keying Non-Return-to-Zero (OOK-NRZ)                         |
| `CORRECT_program_4p5.m`  | Program 4.5: MATLAB code to simulate BER of OOK-NRZ using a matched filter-based receiver                                       |
| `CORRECT_plot_Fig4p13.m` | Program 4.10: MATLAB code to calculate Power Spectral Density (PSD) of Discrete Pulse Interval Modulation (DPIM) (0 Guard Slot) |

## Usage

To use these scripts, ensure that `util/` is included in your MATLAB path. This can be done by adding the following line to your MATLAB startup script or running it directly in the MATLAB command window:

```matlab
addpath('path/to/util');
```

Replace `'path/to/util'` with the actual path to the `util/` directory.
